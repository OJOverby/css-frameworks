Pictroid is a social media site from photo enthusiast. It is a site where you can post your photos and share them with enthusiast who enjoy the photos more then the profiles who is sharing them. The site is a part of learning bootstrap so I tried to use as little custom css as possible on this site.

The design is trying to stay inline with other social media sites for easy usability for the user. The site has a top header on desktop but a footer navbar for mobile, for easier accessibilty when using thumbs on mobile devices.
